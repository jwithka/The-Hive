# The Hive
*A joke sideproject for webscraping practice*

## Main concept
This program will automatically generate a folder on the user's desktop. As of right now, if the user has a Google Chrome web driver installed, it will search Google Images for images of bees and download any results to the folder. The folder is called "The Hive". The program's catch phrase is "save the bees", in case you were wondering.
